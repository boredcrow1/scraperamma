CRISPR gene editing has arrived. Here’s what that means 11.23.2023
Prioritize, focus and create a cycle of success Restructure core elements of your business to be self-supporting and interconnected across technology, talent and ESG. MODERN OPERATIONS Seizing opportunities for future-ready businesses Operations is experiencing an identity shift from back-office management of routine tasks to a strategic source of innovation and competitive advantage. Businesses have discovered that the only way to embrace the new is to ensure that the processes are built for simplicity, elegance, and ingenuity. Learn more TECHNOLOGY New technology is not a guarantee of value A value challenge looms as businesses struggle to realize returns from new technology investments. And we see transformation drivers like IoT, cloud and AI rapidly becoming table stakes, making room for emerging technologies like blockchain, quantum computing and robotics to uncover new possibilities. Learn more TALENT Workforce strategies need a major overhaul While many see a shrinking labor pool as the main issue facing talent management, the reality is that companies are falling short in preparing people for the future of work. Explore how focusing on technology without fully investing in the people behind it creates barriers to future readiness. Learn more ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE Close the gap between ESG commitments and action 90% of decision makers agree you can’t be a modern business without a cohesive ESG strategy. But there’s a huge disconnect between actual plans and real action—a gap that must close as customers, employees, investors and regulators increasingly scrutinize ESG progress and begin holding companies more accountable.

2 Proprietary & Confidential. © 2021, Everest Global, Inc. | EGR-2021-32-E-4765  Everest Group PEAK Matrix ®  for Quality Assurance Service Providers 2021  Background of the research    Increased adoption of agile, DevOps, and next-generation technologies such as AR/VR,AI/ML, and IoT has changed the applications testing landscape. Enterprises are no longer  looking for monthly or quarterly releases, they are aiming for tens or hundreds of releases daily or weekly, which means testing cannot be a later stage activity, but has to transform itself  into an engineering practice. Thus, service providers are innovating at a faster pace with focus on extreme automation and embedding AI/ML, thus optimizing the testing process    COVID-19 brought unprecedented customer demands and the need for scalability, which drove the Quality Assurance (QA) service providers to embrace non-functional testing such as  security testing, performance testing, accessibility, and compatibility testing in their portfolio. Crowdsourced QA testing was also among those testing services, which experienced  sufficient traction to accommodate various use cases such as localization testing and even security testing    This need gave rise to a talent gap, and service providers had to train their workforce remotely to meet the demand for next-generation technologies, and increase investments in talent  to transform into the Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) model and support the change happening in the industry  The assessment is based on Everest Group’s annual RFI process conducted over Q1 2021, interactions with leading QA service providers, and analysis of the QA services market.  This report includes the profiles of the following 33 leading ABC service providers featured on the Quality Assurance services (QA) PEAK Matrix:    Leaders:  Accenture, Capgemini, Cognizant, HCL Technologies, IBM, Infosys, TCS, and Wipro    Major Contenders:  Atos, Cigniti, Cybage, DXC Technology, EPAM, Infogain, LTI, Mindtree, QA Consultants, Qualitest, QualityKiosk, Softtek, Tavant, Tech Mahindra, TestingXperts,  UST, ValueLabs, Virtusa, and Zensar    Aspirants:  Aspire Systems, Jade Global, Mastek, Mphasis, Sonata Software, and TO THE NEW  Geography  Service providers  Services  Global  33  Quality assurance services  Scope of this report:

This document has been licensed to  Cognizant  EGR-2021-32-E-4765  Focus on Cognizant  November 2021  Everest Group PEAK Matrix ®  for Quality Assurance Service Providers 2021 2 Proprietary & Confidential. © 2021, Everest Global, Inc. | EGR-2021-32-E-4765  Everest Group PEAK Matrix ®  for Quality Assurance Service Providers 2021  Background of the research    Increased adoption of agile, DevOps, and next-generation technologies such as AR/VR,AI/ML, and IoT has changed the applications testing landscape. Enterprises are no longer  looking for monthly or quarterly releases, they are aiming for tens or hundreds of releases daily or weekly, which means testing cannot be a later stage activity, but has to transform itself  into an engineering practice. Thus, service providers are innovating at a faster pace with focus on extreme automation and embedding AI/ML, thus optimizing the testing process    COVID-19 brought unprecedented customer demands and the need for scalability, which drove the Quality Assurance (QA) service providers to embrace non-functional testing such as  security testing, performance testing, accessibility, and compatibility testing in their portfolio. Crowdsourced QA testing was also among those testing services, which experienced  sufficient traction to accommodate various use cases such as localization testing and even security testing    This need gave rise to a talent gap, and service providers had to train their workforce remotely to meet the demand for next-generation technologies, and increase investments in talent  to transform into the Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) model and support the change happening in the industry  The assessment is based on Everest Group’s annual RFI process conducted over Q1 2021, interactions with leading QA service providers, and analysis of the QA services market.  This report includes the profiles of the following 33 leading ABC service providers featured on the Quality Assurance services (QA) PEAK Matrix:    Leaders:  Accenture, Capgemini, Cognizant, HCL Technologies, IBM, Infosys, TCS, and Wipro    Major Contenders:  Atos, Cigniti, Cybage, DXC Technology, EPAM, Infogain, LTI, Mindtree, QA Consultants, Qualitest, QualityKiosk, Softtek, Tavant, Tech Mahindra, TestingXperts,  UST, ValueLabs, Virtusa, and Zensar    Aspirants:  Aspire Systems, Jade Global, Mastek, Mphasis, Sonata Software, and TO THE NEW  Geography  Service providers  Services  Global  33  Quality assurance services  Scope of this report:

This document has been licensed to  Cognizant  EGR-2021-32-E-4765  Focus on Cognizant  November 2021  Everest Group PEAK Matrix ®  for Quality Assurance Service Providers 2021 2 Proprietary & Confidential. © 2021, Everest Global, Inc. | EGR-2021-32-E-4765  Everest Group PEAK Matrix ®  for Quality Assurance Service Providers 2021  Background of the research    Increased adoption of agile, DevOps, and next-generation technologies such as AR/VR,AI/ML, and IoT has changed the applications testing landscape. Enterprises are no longer  looking for monthly or quarterly releases, they are aiming for tens or hundreds of releases daily or weekly, which means testing cannot be a later stage activity, but has to transform itself  into an engineering practice. Thus, service providers are innovating at a faster pace with focus on extreme automation and embedding AI/ML, thus optimizing the testing process    COVID-19 brought unprecedented customer demands and the need for scalability, which drove the Quality Assurance (QA) service providers to embrace non-functional testing such as  security testing, performance testing, accessibility, and compatibility testing in their portfolio. Crowdsourced QA testing was also among those testing services, which experienced  sufficient traction to accommodate various use cases such as localization testing and even security testing    This need gave rise to a talent gap, and service providers had to train their workforce remotely to meet the demand for next-generation technologies, and increase investments in talent  to transform into the Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) model and support the change happening in the industry  The assessment is based on Everest Group’s annual RFI process conducted over Q1 2021, interactions with leading QA service providers, and analysis of the QA services market.
